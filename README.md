# Java OOP Study Project

This is a basic Java project created for studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
The project includes examples of class inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, functional interfaces, generics, and the use of Java features such as sealed classes, enums, and streams.

## ðŸ“š Features

- Abstract and sealed classes (`Content`, `Course`, `Mentorship`)
- Functional interfaces
- Generics for flexible typing
- Use of `Optional` and Stream API
- Basic exception handling
- Progress tracking for content subscription and completion
